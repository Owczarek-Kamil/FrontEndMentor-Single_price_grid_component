# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is a solution to the [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS preprocesor
- BEM naming convention
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since this is my public repo and my first project ever shown to the world, please criticize as much as possible, so I can learn from your feedback :)

In this project I have tried to solidify my CSS skills by creating a single price grid component using BEM naming convention for class names, SASS preprocessor to output CSS style sheets. I have also tried to start from mobile design first workflow. Unfortunately, I am not so keen on media queries, so I have created only one breakpoint between mobile/desktop version of component.
